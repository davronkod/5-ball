            <p class="the7">The Aro Experience</p>
            <p class="aro7">Aro is so much more than an app and box for you phone. It’s about what happens once you
                put down your phone. Aro lets parents and kids connect by creating an environment where phones
                aren't a distraction.</p>

            <p class="the01">The Aro App</p>
            <p class="aro01">The Aro app gamifies the experience of being off your phone. The app automatically
                connects to the Aro Home device, measures the time you spend away from your phone, reminds you to
                take breaks from your phone, shows you data to improve your phone habits, and even lets you connect
                and compete with others.</p>

                automatically connects to your phone when it’s placed inside and starts measuring the time you spend
                away from your phone. Oh yeah. It charges five phones at once too.</p>

            <p class="q2">Creates space from your phone</p>
            <p class="q3">Unlike other solutions designed to reduce screen time, the Aro platform combines an app
                and a physical device to create distance between you and your phone so you can have quality time
                without the distraction of your phone.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/IMAGE (1).jpg" alt="" class="q12">
            <p class="q22">Gives you credit for intentional time</p>
            <p class="q32">We live in a gamified world - badges, streaks, achievements, and filling in that daily
                ring. Aro gives you credit for the time you spend engaged in real life because the reward builds the
                habit of putting down your phone.</p>

                and kids. From a beautiful device Mom won’t hate on the kitchen counter to the celebratory GIFs in
                the app, Aro appeals to the whole family.</p>

                are not practical solutions. We need our phones...but maybe not at the dinner table or during a
                conversation. We designed Aro to fit in your everyday rhythms.</p>
